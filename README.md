_Abstract:_ Thousands of randomly generated, fictitious resumes were submitted to job postings in pairs where the treatment resume contained pronouns listed below the name and the control resume did not. Two treatments were considered: nonbinary "they/them” and binary "he/him” or "she/her” pronouns congruent with implied sex. Results show that disclosing nonbinary pronouns reduces positive employer response by 5.4 to 5.5 percentage points; estimates are statistically significant and robust to the Heckman-Siegelman critique. There is suggestive evidence that discrimination is larger (approximately double) in Republican than Democratic geographies, potentially reflecting attitudinal differences. Applicants with multiple minority identities are doubly disadvantaged: for example, disclosing nonbinary pronouns while applying to a male-dominated occupation as a female reduces positive employer response by 10.9 to 11.8 percentage points relative to males who do not disclose pronouns. By comparison, there is limited evidence that disclosing binary pronouns reduces positive employer response.
